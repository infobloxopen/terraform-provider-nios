## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each resource and data source, including all supported attributes and their descriptions, is available in the `docs` directory of this repository:

- Resource documentation: `docs/resources/`
- Data source documentation: `docs/data-sources/`

Each documentation file contains comprehensive information about:
- Required and optional attributes
- Computed attributes returned by the API
- Examples of usage

We recommend referring to these documentation files for the most up-to-date and detailed information about working with specific NIOS objects.
You can also refer to the [Infoblox NIOS WAPI documentation](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/NIOS/35400616/NIOS) for more information on the API endpoints and their usage.

Alternatively, you can also refer to the [Infoblox NIOS Swagger](https://infobloxopen.github.io/nios-swagger/) to view the API endpoints and their parameters.
