## Schema

### Optional

- `extattrfilters` (Map of String) External Attribute Filters are used to return a more specific list of results by filtering on external attributes. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of this name server group.

Optional:

- `comment` (String) Comment for the name server group; maximum 256 characters.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.
- `external_primaries` (Attributes List) The list of external primary servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--external_primaries))
- `external_secondaries` (Attributes List) The list of external secondary servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--external_secondaries))
- `grid_primary` (Attributes List) The grid primary servers for this group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--grid_primary))
- `grid_secondaries` (Attributes List) The list with Grid members that are secondary servers for this group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--grid_secondaries))
- `is_grid_default` (Boolean) Determines if this name server group is the Grid default.
- `is_multimaster` (Boolean) Determines if the "multiple DNS primaries" feature is enabled for the group.
- `use_external_primary` (Boolean) This flag controls whether the group is using an external primary. Note that modification of this field requires passing values for "grid_secondaries" and "external_primaries".

Read-Only:

- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object , including default attributes.
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.

- `tsig_key` (String) A generated TSIG key.
- `tsig_key_alg` (String) The TSIG key algorithm.
- `tsig_key_name` (String) The TSIG key name.
- `use_tsig_key_name` (Boolean) Use flag for: tsig_key_name

Read-Only:

- `shared_with_ms_parent_delegation` (Boolean) This flag represents whether the name server is shared with the parent Microsoft primary zone's delegation server.
