# nios_dns_record_dname (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DNAME records.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Retrieve a specific DNAME record by filters
data "nios_dns_record_dname" "get_record_using_filters" {
  filters = {
    target = "example-dname-1.com"
  }
}

// Retrieve specific DNAME records using Extensible Attributes
data "nios_dns_record_dname" "get_record_using_extensible_attributes" {
  extattrfilters = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Retrieve all DNAME records
data "nios_dns_record_dname" "get_all_records_in_default_view" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `extattrfilters` (Map of String) External Attribute Filters are used to return a more specific list of results by filtering on external attributes. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

- `comment` (String) The comment for the record.
- `creator` (String) The record creator.
- `ddns_principal` (String) The GSS-TSIG principal that owns this record.

- `use_ttl` (Boolean) Use flag for: ttl
- `view` (String) The name of the DNS View in which the record resides, for example "external".

Read-Only:

- `dns_target` (String) The target domain name of the DNS DNAME record in punycode format.
- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object , including default attributes.
- `last_queried` (Number) The time of the last DNS query in Epoch seconds format.
- `reclaimable` (Boolean) Determines if the record is reclaimable.
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.
- `shared_record_group` (String) The name of the shared record group in which the record resides. This field exists only on db_objects if this record is a shared record.

- `delegated_scope` (String) Indicates the scope of delegation for the object. This can be one of the following: NONE (outside any delegation), ROOT (the delegation point), SUBTREE (within the scope of a delegation), RECLAIMING (within the scope of a delegation being reclaimed, either as the delegation point or in the subtree).
