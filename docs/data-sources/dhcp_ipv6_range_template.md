# nios_dhcp_ipv6_range_template (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing IPV6 Range Templates.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Retrieve a specific IPV6 Range Template by filters
data "nios_dhcp_ipv6_range_template" "get_ipv6_range_template_using_filters" {
  filters = {
    name = "example_ipv6_range_template"
  }
}

// Retrieve all IPV6 Range Templates
data "nios_dhcp_ipv6_range_template" "get_all_ipv6_range_templates" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the IPv6 DHCP range template.
- `number_of_addresses` (Number) The number of addresses for the IPv6 DHCP range.
- `offset` (Number) The start address offset for the IPv6 DHCP range.

Optional:

- `cloud_api_compatible` (Boolean) Determines whether the IPv6 DHCP range template can be used to create network objects in a cloud-computing deployment. The cloud_api_compatible attribute must be set to true if any extensible attributes, such as the Terraform Internal ID, require cloud access; otherwise, it must be set to false.
- `comment` (String) The IPv6 DHCP range template descriptive comment.
- `delegated_member` (Attributes) The vConnector member that the object should be delegated to when created from the IPv6 DHCP range template. The vConnector refers to VMware vConnector. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--delegated_member))
- `exclude` (Attributes List) These are ranges of IPv6 addresses that the appliance does not use to assign to clients. You can use these excluded addresses as static IPv6 addresses. They contain the start and end addresses of the excluded range, and optionally, information about this excluded range. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--exclude))
- `logic_filter_rules` (Attributes List) This field contains the logic filters to be applied on this IPv6 range. This list corresponds to the match rules that are written to the DHCPv6 configuration file. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--logic_filter_rules))
- `member` (Attributes) The member that will provide service for the IPv6 DHCP range. Set `server_association_type` to `MEMBER` if you want the server specified here to serve the range. For searching by this field, use an HTTP method that contains a body (POST or PUT) with MS DHCP server structure and the request should have option _method=GET. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--member))
- `option_filter_rules` (Attributes List) This field contains the Option filters to be applied to this IPv6 range. The appliance uses the matching rules of these filters to select the address range from which it assigns a lease. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--option_filter_rules))
- `recycle_leases` (Boolean) Determines whether the leases are kept in Recycle Bin until one week after expiry. If this is set to False, the leases are permanently deleted.
- `server_association_type` (String) The type of server that is going to serve the IPv6 DHCP range. Valid values are `MEMBER` and `NONE`.
- `use_logic_filter_rules` (Boolean) Use flag for: logic_filter_rules
- `use_recycle_leases` (Boolean) Use flag for: recycle_leases

Read-Only:

- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.

<a id="nestedatt--result--exclude"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.exclude`

Required:
