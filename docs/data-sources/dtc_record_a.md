# nios_dtc_record_a (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DTC A Records.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Note: DTC A Record cannot be retrieved without filters. The dtc_server filter is mandatory for all queries.

// Retrieve a specific DTC A Record in a DTC server using filters 
data "nios_dtc_record_a" "get_dtc_record_a_in_dtc_server_using_filters" {
  filters = {
    dtc_server = "example-server"
    ipv4addr   = "2.2.2.2"
  }
}


// Retrieve all DTC A Records in a DTC server
data "nios_dtc_record_a" "get_all_dtc_record_a_in_dtc_server" {
  filters = {
    dtc_server = "example-server"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.The 'dtc_server' filter is required and must be specified for searching DTC A records.

### Optional

- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))
