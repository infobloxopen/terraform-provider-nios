# nios_dtc_monitor_sip (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DTC SIP Monitors

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Retrieve a specific DTC SIP Monitor by filters
data "nios_dtc_monitor_sip" "get_dtc_sip_monitor_with_filter" {
  filters = {
    name = "example-monitor-sip"
  }
}

// Retrieve specific DTC SIP Monitors using Extensible Attributes
data "nios_dtc_monitor_sip" "get_dtc_sip_monitor_with_extattr_filter" {
  extattrfilters = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Retrieve all DTC SIP Monitors
data "nios_dtc_monitor_sip" "get_all_dtc_sip_monitors" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `extattrfilters` (Map of String) External Attribute Filters are used to return a more specific list of results by filtering on external attributes. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

- `client_cert` (String) An optional client certificate, supplied in TLS and SIPS mode if present.
- `comment` (String) Comment for this DTC monitor; maximum 256 characters.

- `interval` (Number) The interval for TCP health check.
- `port` (Number) The port value for SIP requests.
- `request` (String) A SIP request to send
- `result` (String) The type of an expected result.

- `retry_down` (Number) The value of how many times the server should appear as down to be treated as dead after it was alive.
- `retry_up` (Number) The value of how many times the server should appear as up to be treated as alive after it was dead.
- `timeout` (Number) The timeout for TCP health check in seconds.
- `transport` (String) The transport layer protocol to use for SIP check.
- `validate_cert` (Boolean) Determines whether the validation of the remote server's certificate is enabled.
