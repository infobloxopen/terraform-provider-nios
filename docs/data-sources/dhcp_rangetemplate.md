# nios_dhcp_rangetemplate (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DHCP Range Template Records.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Retrieve a specific Range template record by filters
data "nios_dhcp_rangetemplate" "get_record_using_filters" {
  filters = {
    name = "example_range_template"
  }
}

// Retrieve specific Range template records using Extensible Attributes
data "nios_dhcp_rangetemplate" "get_record_using_extensible_attributes" {
  extattrfilters = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Retrieve all Range template records
data "nios_dhcp_rangetemplate" "get_all_records" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `extattrfilters` (Map of String) External Attribute Filters are used to return a more specific list of results by filtering on external attributes. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of a range template object.
- `number_of_addresses` (Number) The number of addresses for this range.
- `offset` (Number) The start address offset for this range.

Optional:

- `bootfile` (String) The bootfile name for the range. You can configure the DHCP server to support clients that use the boot file name option in their DHCPREQUEST messages.

- `known_clients` (String) Permission for known clients. If set to 'Deny' known clients will be denied IP addresses. Known clients include roaming hosts and clients with fixed addresses or DHCP host entries.

The range is from 1 to 100. The low watermark reset value must be higher than the low watermark value.
- `mac_filter_rules` (Attributes List) This field contains the MAC filters to be applied to this range. The appliance uses the matching rules of these filters to select the address range from which it assigns a lease. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--mac_filter_rules))

To better manage your IP resources, set a different lease time for PXE boot requests. You can configure the DHCP server to allocate an IP address with a shorter lease time to hosts that send PXE boot requests, so IP addresses are not leased longer than necessary. A 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the duration, in seconds, for which the update is cached. Zero indicates that the update is not cached.
