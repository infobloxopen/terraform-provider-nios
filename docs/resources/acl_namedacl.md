# nios_acl_namedacl (Resource)

Manages Named Access Control Lists (ACLs)

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create Named Access Control Lists (ACLs) with basic fields
resource "nios_acl_namedacl" "base_namedacl" {
  name    = "base-acl-template"
  comment = "Base ACL structure created for future assignment of access control entries"

  // Extensible Attributes
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Create Named Access Control Lists (ACLs) with additional fields
resource "nios_acl_namedacl" "namedacl_with_additional_config" {
  name    = "dev-network-acl"
  comment = "ACL to allow/deny access to specific dev network resources"

  // ACL Entries
  acl = [
    {
      struct     = "addressac"
      address    = "10.0.0.1"
      permission = "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      struct     = "addressac"
      address    = "10.0.0.2"
      permission = "DENY"
    }
  ]

  // Extensible Attributes
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-2"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the named ACL.

### Optional

- `access_list` (Attributes List) The access control list of IPv4/IPv6 addresses, networks, TSIG-based anonymous access controls, and other named ACLs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_list))
- `comment` (String) Comment for the named ACL; maximum 256 characters.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.

### Read-Only

- `exploded_access_list` (Attributes List) The exploded access list for the named ACL. This list displays all the access control entries in a named ACL and its nested named ACLs, if applicable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--exploded_access_list))
- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object, including default attributes.
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.

### Nested Schema for `access_list`

Required:

- `struct` (String) The struct type of the object. The value must be one of 'addressac' and 'tsigac'.

Optional:

- `address` (String) The address this rule applies to or "Any".
- `permission` (String) The permission to use for this address.
- `tsig_key` (String) A generated TSIG key. If the external primary server is a NIOS appliance running DNS One 2.x code, this can be set to :2xCOMPAT.
- `tsig_key_alg` (String) The TSIG key algorithm.
- `tsig_key_name` (String) The name of the TSIG key. If 2.x TSIG compatibility is used, this is set to 'tsig_xfer' on retrieval, and ignored on insert or update.
- `use_tsig_key_name` (Boolean) Use flag for: tsig_key_name
