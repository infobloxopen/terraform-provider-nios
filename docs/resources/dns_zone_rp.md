# nios_dns_zone_rp (Resource)

Manages a DNS RPZ (Response Policy Zone).

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create IPV4 forward mapping zone with Basic Fields
resource "nios_dns_zone_rp" "zone_rp_basic_fields" {
  fqdn = "example1.com"
  view = "default"
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Create IPV4 forward mapping zone with Additional Fields
resource "nios_dns_zone_rp" "zone_rp_additional_fields" {
  // Basic Fields
  fqdn = "example2.com"
  view = "default"

  // Additional Fields
  grid_primary = [
    {
      name = "infoblox.member",
    }
  ]

  soa_default_ttl     = 37000
  soa_expire          = 92000

## Schema

### Required

- `fqdn` (String) The name of this DNS zone in FQDN format.

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Comment for the zone; maximum 256 characters.
- `disable` (Boolean) Determines whether a zone is disabled or not. When this is set to False, the zone is enabled.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object. For valid values for extensible attributes, see {extattrs:values}.
- `external_primaries` (Attributes List) The list of external primary servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--external_primaries))
- `external_secondaries` (Attributes List) The list of external secondary servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--external_secondaries))
- `fireeye_rule_mapping` (Attributes) Rules to map fireeye alerts (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--fireeye_rule_mapping))
- `grid_primary` (Attributes List) The grid primary servers for this zone. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--grid_primary))
- `grid_secondaries` (Attributes List) The list with Grid members that are secondary servers for this zone. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--grid_secondaries))
- `locked` (Boolean) If you enable this flag, other administrators cannot make conflicting changes. This is for administration purposes only. The zone will continue to serve DNS data even when it is locked.
- `log_rpz` (Boolean) Determines whether RPZ logging enabled or not at zone level. When this is set to False, the logging is disabled.
- `member_soa_mnames` (Attributes List) The list of per-member SOA MNAME information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--member_soa_mnames))
- `ns_group` (String) The name server group that serves DNS for this zone.
- `prefix` (String) The RFC2317 prefix value of this DNS zone. Use this field only when the netmask is greater than 24 bits; that is, for a mask between 25 and 31 bits. Enter a prefix, such as the name of the allocated address block. The prefix can be alphanumeric characters, such as 128/26 , 128-189 , or sub-B.
- `record_name_policy` (String) The hostname policy for records under this zone.
- `rpz_drop_ip_rule_enabled` (Boolean) Enables the appliance to ignore RPZ-IP triggers with prefix lengths less than the specified minimum prefix length.
- `rpz_drop_ip_rule_min_prefix_length_ipv4` (Number) The minimum prefix length for IPv4 RPZ-IP triggers. The appliance ignores RPZ-IP triggers with prefix lengths less than the specified minimum IPv4 prefix length.
- `rpz_drop_ip_rule_min_prefix_length_ipv6` (Number) The minimum prefix length for IPv6 RPZ-IP triggers. The appliance ignores RPZ-IP triggers with prefix lengths less than the specified minimum IPv6 prefix length.
- `rpz_policy` (String) The response policy zone override policy.

The Infoblox appliance allows you to change the serial number (in the SOA record) for the primary server so it is higher than the secondary server, thereby ensuring zone transfers come from the primary server (as they should). To change the serial number you need to set a new value at "soa_serial_number" and pass "set_soa_serial_number" as True.
- `soa_default_ttl` (Number) The Time to Live (TTL) value of the SOA record of this zone. This value is the number of seconds that data is cached.
- `soa_email` (String) The SOA email value for this zone. This value can be in unicode format.
- `soa_expire` (Number) This setting defines the amount of time, in seconds, after which the secondary server stops giving out answers about the zone because the zone data is too old to be useful. The default is one week.
- `soa_negative_ttl` (Number) The negative Time to Live (TTL) value of the SOA of the zone indicates how long a secondary server can cache data for "Does Not Respond" responses.
- `soa_refresh` (Number) This indicates the interval at which a secondary server sends a message to the primary server for a zone to check that its data is current, and retrieve fresh data if it is not.
- `soa_retry` (Number) This indicates how long a secondary server must wait before attempting to recontact the primary server after a connection failure between the two servers occurs.
- `soa_serial_number` (Number) The serial number in the SOA record incrementally changes every time the record is modified. The Infoblox appliance allows you to change the serial number (in the SOA record) for the primary server so it is higher than the secondary server, thereby ensuring zone transfers come from the primary server (as they should). To change the serial number you need to set a new value at "soa_serial_number" and pass "set_soa_serial_number" as True.
- `substitute_name` (String) The canonical name of redirect target in substitute policy of response policy zone.
- `use_external_primary` (Boolean) This flag controls whether the zone is using an external primary.
- `use_grid_zone_timer` (Boolean) Use flag for: soa_default_ttl , soa_expire, soa_negative_ttl, soa_refresh, soa_retry
- `use_log_rpz` (Boolean) Use flag for: log_rpz
- `use_record_name_policy` (Boolean) Use flag for: record_name_policy
- `use_rpz_drop_ip_rule` (Boolean) Use flag for: rpz_drop_ip_rule_enabled , rpz_drop_ip_rule_min_prefix_length_ipv4, rpz_drop_ip_rule_min_prefix_length_ipv6
