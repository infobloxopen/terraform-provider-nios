# nios_dns_nsgroup (Resource)

Manages a NS group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create NS group with Basic Fields
resource "nios_dns_nsgroup" "create_ns_group" {
  name = "example_ns_group"
  grid_primary = [
    {
      name = "infoblox.localdomain"
    }
  ]
}

// Create NS Group with Additional Fields
resource "nios_dns_nsgroup" "create_ns_group_with_additional_fields" {
  name    = "example_ns_group_1"
  comment = "Example NS Group"

  grid_secondaries = [
    {
      name = "12.9.0.6",
    },
  ]
  external_primaries = [
    {
      name    = "external.primary.1",
      address = "2.3.4.5",
    },
  ]
  use_external_primary = true
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of this name server group.

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Comment for the name server group; maximum 256 characters.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.
- `external_primaries` (Attributes List) The list of external primary servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--external_primaries))
- `external_secondaries` (Attributes List) The list of external secondary servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--external_secondaries))
- `grid_primary` (Attributes List) The grid primary servers for this group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--grid_primary))
- `grid_secondaries` (Attributes List) The list with Grid members that are secondary servers for this group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--grid_secondaries))
- `is_grid_default` (Boolean) Determines if this name server group is the Grid default.
- `is_multimaster` (Boolean) Determines if the "multiple DNS primaries" feature is enabled for the group.
- `use_external_primary` (Boolean) This flag controls whether the group is using an external primary. Note that modification of this field requires passing values for "grid_secondaries" and "external_primaries".

### Read-Only

- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object , including default attributes.
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.
