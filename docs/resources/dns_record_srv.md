# nios_dns_record_srv (Resource)

Manages a SRV Record.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create Record SRV with Basic Fields
resource "nios_dns_record_srv" "create_record" {
  name     = "example-srv-record.example.com"
  target   = "example.target.com"
  port     = 80
  priority = 4
  weight   = 50

  // Extensible Attributes
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Create Record SRV with additional fields
resource "nios_dns_record_srv" "create_with_additional_config" {
  name     = "example-srv-record-with-config.example.com"
  target   = "example_updated.target.com"
  port     = 8080
  priority = 2
  weight   = 100

  // Additional Fields
  view    = "default"
  use_ttl = true
  ttl     = 10
  creator = "DYNAMIC"
  comment = "Example SRV record"

  // Extensible Attributes
