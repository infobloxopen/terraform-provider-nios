# nios_grid_servicerestart_group (Resource)

Manages a GRID Service Restart Group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create a Service Restart Group with Basic Fields
resource "nios_grid_servicerestart_group" "grid_servicerestart_group_with_basic_fields" {
  name    = "example_grid_service_restart_group"
  service = "DNS"
}

// Create a Service Restart Group with Additional Fields
resource "nios_grid_servicerestart_group" "grid_servicerestart_group_with_additional_fields" {
  name    = "example_grid_service_restart_group_additional"
  service = "DHCP"
  comment = "Comment for GRID Service Restart Group"


  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }

  members = ["infoblox.member"]
  mode    = "SEQUENTIAL"

  recurring_schedule = {
    services = ["ALL"]
    mode     = "SIMULTANEOUS"
    force    = false
    disabled = false

    schedule = {
      minutes_past_hour = 6
      repeat            = "ONCE"
      day_of_month      = 30
      month             = 1
      year              = 2026
      hour_of_day       = 20

### Nested Schema for `recurring_schedule.schedule`

Optional:

- `day_of_month` (Number) The day of the month for the scheduled task.
- `disable` (Boolean) If set to True, the scheduled task is disabled.
- `every` (Number) The number of frequency to wait before repeating the scheduled task.
- `frequency` (String) The frequency for the scheduled task.

Please use other applicable fields to define the recurring schedule. DO NOT use recurring_time together with these fields. If you use recurring_time with other fields to define the recurring schedule, recurring_time has priority over year, hour_of_day, and minutes_past_hour and will override the values of these fields, although it does not override month and day_of_month. In this case, the recurring time value might be different than the intended value that you define.
