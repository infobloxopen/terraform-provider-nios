## Example Usage

```terraform
# Associate MAC address with host1's IP without DHCP configuration

  ref                = nios_ip_allocation.allocation1.ref
  mac                = "12:00:43:fe:9a:8c"

}

# Associate MAC and DUID with host2's IP with DHCP configuration enabled
resource "nios_ip_association" "association2" {
  ref                = nios_ip_allocation.allocation2.ref
  mac                = "12:43:fd:ba:9c:c9"
