resource "nios_dhcp_macfilteraddress" "mac_filter_address_basic_fields" {
  mac    = "00:5A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
  filter = nios_dhcp_filtermac.parent_mac_filter.name
}

// Create MAC Filter Address with Additional Fields
resource "nios_dhcp_macfilteraddress" "mac_filter_address_additional_fields" {
  mac                   = "01:5A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
  filter                = nios_dhcp_filtermac.parent_mac_filter.name
