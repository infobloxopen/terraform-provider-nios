## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create Network View with Basic Fields
resource "nios_ipam_network_view" "create_network_view" {
  name = "example_network_view"
}

// Create Network View with additional fields
resource "nios_ipam_network_view" "create_network_view_with_additional_fields" {
  name    = "example-network-view2"
  comment = "Example Network View with additional fields"
