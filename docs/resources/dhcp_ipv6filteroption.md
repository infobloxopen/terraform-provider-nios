# nios_dhcp_ipv6filteroption (Resource)

Manages an IPv6 DHCP Option Filter.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create a DHCP IPv6 Filter Option with Basic Fields
resource "nios_dhcp_ipv6filteroption" "dhcp_ipv6filteroption_with_basic_fields" {
  name = "example_ipv6_filter_option_1"
}

// Create a DHCP IPv6 Filter Option with Additional Fields
resource "nios_dhcp_ipv6filteroption" "dhcp_ipv6filteroption_with_additional_fields" {
  name = "example_ipv6_filter_option_2"

  // Additional Fields
  comment    = "IPv6 Filter Option created via Terraform"
  expression = "(option dhcp6.server-id=\"server-id\" AND option dhcp6.vendor-class=\"DHCPv6\")"
  lease_time = 7200
  option_list = [
    {
      name         = "dhcp6.name-servers"
      num          = 23
      value        = "fc00::,2001:db8::"
      vendor_class = "DHCPv6"
    },
    {
      name         = "dhcp6.remote-id"
      num          = 37
      value        = "remote-id"
      vendor_class = "DHCPv6"
    }
  ]

  //Extensible Attributes
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of a DHCP IPv6 option filter object.

### Optional

- `apply_as_class` (Boolean) Determines if apply as class is enabled or not. If this flag is set to "true" the filter is treated as global DHCP class, e.g it is written to DHCPv6 configuration file even if it is not present in any DHCP range.
- `comment` (String) The descriptive comment of a DHCP IPv6 filter option object.
- `expression` (String) The conditional expression of a DHCP IPv6 filter option object.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.
- `lease_time` (Number) Determines the lease time of a DHCP IPv6 filter option object.
- `option_list` (Attributes List) An array of DHCP option dhcpoption structs that lists the DHCP options associated with the object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--option_list))
- `option_space` (String) The option space of a DHCP IPv6 filter option object.

### Read-Only

- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object, including default and internal attributes.
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.

### Nested Schema for `option_list`

Required:

- `value` (String) Value of the DHCP option. Required to be set for all options.

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name of the DHCP option.
- `num` (Number) The code of the DHCP option.
- `use_option` (Boolean) Only applies to special options that are displayed separately from other options and have a use flag. These options are: * routers * router-templates * domain-name-servers * domain-name * broadcast-address * broadcast-address-offset * dhcp-lease-time * dhcp6.name-servers
- `vendor_class` (String) The name of the space this DHCP option is associated to.
